Synopsis:
Introducing MOOV-E, your go-to movie app for an immersive cinematic experience. With its sleek and responsive design, MOOV-E delivers seamless movie browsing on any device. Uncover your favorite films effortlessly with the Movie Search feature and explore diverse categories like Most Popular, Trending, and New releases. Dive into each movie's captivating world through detailed descriptions and thrilling preview trailers.

The goal of this app is to provide a visually pleasing responsive website listing all new movies from a public api. The website will integrate a search feature which user can manually search for a particular title or use one of the inbuilt category. Each movie title will have its own movie card with the Movie Image cover, movie details, genre, casts members, preview trailer (Youtube) as well as showing similar genre movies. The idea is also to integrate a pricing table for a future registration and login system where user can save their favorite movies and buy movie tickets online.
